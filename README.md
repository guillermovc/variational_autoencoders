# Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)

This repository contains code, resources, and examples related to Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). VAEs are a type of generative model that combines deep learning with probabilistic inference to generate new data and learn complex distributions.

## Contents

- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides for understanding and implementing VAEs from scratch.
- **Experiments**: Examples of VAEs applied to various datasets, including image and text data.
- **Scripts**: Reusable scripts for training, testing, and evaluating VAEs.
- **Models**: Pre-trained VAEs and model architectures used in the experiments.
- **Research**: Summaries of key research papers and articles on VAEs.
