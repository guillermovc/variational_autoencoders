# Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)

This repository contains code, resources, and examples related to Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). VAEs are a type of generative model that combines deep learning with probabilistic inference to generate new data and learn complex distributions.

I used code snippets and ideas from the following sources:
- [Build a Convolutional Variational AutoEncoder (CVAE) using PyTorch - Example using USPS dataset (MEDIOCRE_GUY)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoT2DdwSC4E&t=1432s)
- [178 - An introduction to variational autoencoders (VAE) (DigitalSreeni)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV9D3TWY5Zo&t=654s)
- [Variational Autoencoder from scratch in PyTorch (Aladdin Persson)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VELQT1-hILo&t=1708s)

## Contents

- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides for understanding and implementing VAEs from scratch.
- **Experiments**: Examples of VAEs applied to various datasets, including image and text data.
- **Scripts**: Reusable scripts for training, testing, and evaluating VAEs.
- **Models**: Pre-trained VAEs and model architectures used in the experiments.
- **Research**: Summaries of key research papers and articles on VAEs.

## Getting Started

To start using this repository, clone it to your local environment:
